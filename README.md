# Bayes-DecisionTree-practice

Given a 2-class pattern classification problem, train 3 classifiers listed below using the training data, and then predict class labels of the test data.

(1) Bayes decision rule
(2) Na√Øve Bayes
(3) Linear discriminant analysis

The training data is given in TrainingData.xlsx, where columns A-D are the features, and column E gives the class label. The test data is given in TestData.xlsx (30 samples, no label is provided).
(1) Missing values and outliers in the training data.
(2) Train a binary classification tree using the training data. (3) Predict the class label of the test data.
